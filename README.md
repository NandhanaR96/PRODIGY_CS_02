# Simple Image Encryption Tool

## Overview
This project is a simple image encryption tool that utilizes pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. Users can perform operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel. The tool is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts of image processing and encryption.

### Features
 - Encrypt images by manipulating pixel values.
 - Decrypt images to retrieve the original content.
 - Support for basic operations like pixel value swapping and mathematical transformations.
 - User-friendly interface for selecting images and performing encryption/decryption.
### Requirements
 - Python 3.x
 - Required libraries:
    - Pillow for image processing
    - numpy for numerical operations

## Installation
  1.Clone the repository
     https://github.com/NandhanaR96/PRODIGY_CS_02.git
  2.Install the required libraries:
      - pillow
      - numpy
## Brief Summary of code
  1. Opens an image file
  2. Converts it to RGB mode
  3. Swaps adjacent pixel values to "encrypt" the image
  4. Reduces the image size by half
  5. Applies a box blur filter
  6. Saves the encrypted image to a new file.
